To analyze the crash data further and gain more insights, you could consider incorporating additional sources of data that are relevant to traffic accidents. Some examples include:

Weather data: Weather conditions can significantly impact the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents. You can obtain historical weather data from sources like NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) or commercial weather APIs like OpenWeather, Weather Underground, or Dark Sky (before its discontinuation).

Traffic volume data: Understanding the traffic volume in different areas can help you identify patterns and correlations between traffic density and crash frequency. You can find traffic volume data from your local Department of Transportation or other open data sources, like the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for the United States.

Road infrastructure data: The design and condition of road infrastructure can influence accident rates. Information about road types, intersection layouts, traffic signals, roadwork, and maintenance schedules can be helpful. These data can typically be found through local government or transportation agencies.

Demographic data: Investigate whether there are correlations between crash rates and demographic factors like population density, income levels, or age distributions. You can obtain demographic data from sources like the United States Census Bureau or other government statistics offices.

Public transportation data: Analyzing the availability and usage of public transportation may provide insights into how it affects crash rates. Data on bus routes, train lines, and transit stops can be found through local transit agencies or public data portals.

Vehicle registration data: Comparing the distribution of vehicle types involved in crashes to the overall vehicle population in the area may reveal interesting patterns. Vehicle registration data can often be found through local motor vehicle agencies.

Geospatial data: Adding a spatial context to your analysis can help identify accident hotspots and patterns. You can use GIS (Geographic Information System) data from sources like OpenStreetMap, USGS, or other government and commercial providers.

Enforcement data: Data on traffic law enforcement activities, such as traffic citations or DUI arrests, may help to identify correlations between enforcement and crash rates. This data can usually be obtained from local law enforcement agencies or public data portals.

By combining these additional data sources with your existing crash data, you can conduct a more comprehensive analysis, identify patterns, and potentially develop solutions to reduce traffic accidents.
