 - Can the data visualize areas of concern?  Does each borough or all of NYC have specific areas that are more likely to have accidents?
 - During normal commute times - is there a differnce in number of crashes before or after a workday is completed?

Joan
 - Are specific NYC Boroughs more likely to have accidents than others? (Including checking for population normalization)
 - Compare if fatality accidents had multiple vehicles more often than single car accidents. 
 - Determine if accidents are more likely during certain months.

Ginger
 - Can we better visualize the number of crashes based on the time of day, month, or number of vehicles through scatter plots.
 - Does winter or summer have any effect on the number of accidents?
