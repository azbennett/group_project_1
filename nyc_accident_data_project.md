**#Project Title:**  
 - NYC Analysis of Accident Data  

**#Team Members:**  
 - Ginger Francione
 - Joan Montilla
 - Mohammad Satti
 - Steve Bennett

**#Project Description/Outline:**  
 - Comparitive Analysis of accident data based over time, boroughs and latitude/longitude locations.  

**#Questions to Answer:**   
 - Determine if accidents are more prone during certain weather/time.
 - Same idea if they are more prone in certain areas or boroughs.   
 - Will population cause a distorted view of the data. e.g. Manhattan has far more population than Staten Island.
 - Just because there are more people does not always mean there are more vehicles since not everyone drives in the inner city.
 - Compare if fatality accidents had multiple vehicles more often than single car accidents. 

**#Datasets to be used:**  

 - [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes  ](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes)
 - Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes
 - The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage  

**#Rough Breakdown of Tasks:**  
**#Steve:**  
 - Clean up data source so team can use for graphing.  
 - Display map plot data  / heatmaps
 - Assist with team as needed

 **#Ginger:**  
 - Display scatter plots of temp for month for each borough.

 **#Joan:**  
 - Display bar charts of number of accidents compared to borough

        
 **#Mohammad:**  
 - Display charts/graphs to compare winter (Dec/Jan/Feb) to summer
   (June/July/Aug)
